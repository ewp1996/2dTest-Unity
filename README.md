# 2dTest
 
My first attempt at working through every step of game development

There is still a lot that needs to be done, but I wanted to put what has been completed so far up on Github.

This project was created in Unity.

To skip the code and download a simple build of the WIP, click the 2dTest Build.zip and download the folder.

After that go to the .exe and you are good to go!
